#  functions are sets block of instructions

the "hello" is the argument
NOTE: A PARAM is like a placeholder in a function thatg recieves any argument passsed
the greeting param is in a local scope ; meaning it's within a function not global

this is a multiple param in a function
the "name serves as a default incase there is no value for greeting"

this allows us to print abituary number of positional or keywowrd args

args print out positional arguments
kwargs print out an arguments with "keys"
NOTE: this one accepts values as args and print them as tuple and dict.
