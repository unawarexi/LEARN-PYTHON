# ERROR Handling 


### Common Types of Errors in Python Error Handling

| Error Type            | Description                                                         | Resolution                                                                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SyntaxError           | Occurs due to incorrect syntax in the code.                         | Review code for syntax errors and correct them.                                |
| IndentationError      | Arises from incorrect indentation in the code.                      | Ensure consistent and proper indentation throughout the code.                  |
| NameError             | Happens when a name used is not found in the current scope.         | Define the name or check the scope where the name is expected to be found.     |
| TypeError             | Occurs when an operation is performed on an object of inappropriate type. | Check data types involved in the operation and convert them if necessary.      |
| ValueError            | Happens when a function receives an argument with an inappropriate value. | Validate input values before processing them in the function.                 |
| KeyError              | Occurs when a dictionary key is not found.                         | Verify the existence of the key in the dictionary before accessing it.         |
| IndexError            | Occurs when attempting to access an index that is out of range.     | Ensure that the index is within the bounds of the sequence being accessed.     |
| FileNotFoundError     | Occurs when a file or directory is requested but cannot be found.   | Double-check the file or directory path to ensure it exists and is accessible. |
| IOError               | Occurs when an I/O operation (e.g., file operation) fails.          | Verify file permissions, existence, and proper handling of file operations.    |
| ImportError           | Happens when a requested module cannot be found.                    | Install the missing module using pip or ensure it's available in the environment.|
| AttributeError        | Occurs when an attribute reference or assignment fails.             | Check the object and verify if the attribute exists or is accessible.          |
| ZeroDivisionError     | Happens when division or modulo operation is performed with zero as the divisor. | Avoid division or modulo operations with zero as the divisor.               |
| RuntimeError          | Generic error for runtime issues not covered by other error types.   | Review the runtime context and code logic to identify and fix the issue.        |
| KeyboardInterrupt     | Occurs when the user interrupts the execution (e.g., Ctrl+C).        | Implement appropriate error handling or handle KeyboardInterrupt gracefully.  |
| NotImplementedError  | Occurs when an abstract method is not implemented in a subclass.     | Implement the missing method in the subclass to resolve the error.             |
| FileExistsError       | Occurs when trying to create a file that already exists.            | Provide a different filename or handle the situation based on application logic.|
| PermissionError       | Occurs when trying to perform an operation without the required permissions. | Adjust file permissions or grant necessary permissions to resolve the error.  |

# Working with CSV Files in Python

- CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are a popular format for storing and exchanging data in a structured format. 
- Python provides `built-in modules` for reading from and writing to CSV files, making it easy to work with tabular data.

## Reading CSV Files

To read data from a CSV file in Python, you can use the `csv` module. Here's a simple example of how to read from a CSV file:

```python
import csv

# Open the CSV file in read mode
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    # Create a CSV reader object
    reader = csv.reader(file)

    # Iterate over each row in the CSV file
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

### Writing to CSV Files
To write data to a CSV file in Python, you can also use the `csv module`. Here's an example of how to write to a CSV file:

```python
import csv

# Sample data to write to the CSV file
data = [
    ['Name', 'Age', 'City'],
    ['John', 30, 'New York'],
    ['Alice', 25, 'Los Angeles'],
    ['Bob', 35, 'Chicago']
]

# Open the CSV file in write mode
with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    # Create a CSV writer object
    writer = csv.writer(file)

    # Write data to the CSV file
    for row in data:
        writer.writerow(row)

print("Data has been written to output.csv")
```

### Additional Features
- Reading and Writing with Dictionaries: Python's csv.DictReader and csv.DictWriter classes allow you to read and write CSV files using dictionaries, which can be more convenient when dealing with labeled data.
- Custom Delimiters and Quote Characters: The csv.reader and csv.writer classes support custom delimiters and quote characters, allowing you to work with CSV files that use different separators and quoting conventions.



# Working with JSON in Python

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format commonly used for exchanging data between a server and a web application. 
- Python provides built-in support for working with JSON through the `json` module, making it easy to `serialize/deserialize` Python objects to/from JSON format.

### Serializing Python Objects to JSON

To serialize Python objects (such as dictionaries, lists, or custom objects) into JSON format, you can use the `json.dumps()` function. Here's an example:

```python
import json

# Python dictionary to serialize to JSON
data = {
    'name': 'John',
    'age': 30,
    'city': 'New York'
}

# Serialize the dictionary to JSON format
json_data = json.dumps(data)

print(json_data)

Output:

json
{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
```

### Deserializing JSON to Python Objects
To deserialize JSON data into Python objects, you can use the `json.loads()` function. Here's how you can deserialize JSON data into a Python dictionary:

```python
import json

# JSON data to deserialize
json_data = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Los Angeles"}'

# Deserialize JSON data to a Python dictionary
data = json.loads(json_data)

print(data)
Output:

{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'Los Angeles'}
```


### Reading and Writing JSON Files
Python also provides functions for reading from and writing to JSON files using the json.dump() and json.load() functions. Here's an example:

```python
import json

# Python dictionary to write to a JSON file
data = {
    'name': 'Bob',
    'age': 35,
    'city': 'Chicago'
}

# Write data to a JSON file
with open('data.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file)

# Read data from the JSON file
with open('data.json', 'r') as file:
    loaded_data = json.load(file)

print(loaded_data)
Output:

{'name': 'Bob', 'age': 35, 'city': 'Chicago'}
```
### Additional Features
- Working with Nested Data: JSON supports nested data structures, allowing you to represent complex hierarchical data.

- Custom Serialization and Deserialization: The json.dumps() and json.loads() functions provide options for custom serialization and deserialization using the default and object_hook parameters, respectively.

- JSON Schema Validation: Python libraries such as jsonschema provide functionality for validating JSON data against a defined schema.
